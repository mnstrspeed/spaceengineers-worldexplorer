World Explorer for Space Engineers
----------------------------------
Turns out it's actually pretty easy to go beyond the 10,000m range of beacons, so 
I had to build this little visualizer to determine my position in the game world.
It reads your save game and shows the position (and size) of you and your creations 
on a 3D map which you can rotate and zoom in to. 

Note to self: just build more beacons next time.
